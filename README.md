🌊 SEAHAWK – Underwater ROV Control System

SEAHAWK is a tethered underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) control and video system designed for reliable, low-latency underwater operation where wireless communication fails.
It uses an Ethernet-based control link and dedicated cable pairs for FPV video, inspired by professional and industrial ROV architectures.
